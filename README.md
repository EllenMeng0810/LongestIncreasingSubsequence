# LongestIncreasingSubsequence
An efficient algorithm to find the length of a longest increasing subsequence of entries in L which is an array of n distinct integers.

L is an array of n distinct integers. Write and implement an efficient algorithm to find the length of a longest increasing subsequence of entries in L. For example, if the entries are 11, 17, 5, 8, 6, 4, 7, 12, 3, a longest increasing subsequence is 5, 6, 7, 12.

The development environment is Visual Studio. The programming language is C++. This problem exists an optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems so that I choose Dynamic Programming technique to solve this problem.
